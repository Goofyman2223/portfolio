Dummy Demolisher is my first official game

This game features a settings menu, info menu, two gamemodes, sound fx/music, and much more.

(Also let me know how to fix the error for the files not being found through the github directory, it works if files are downloaded seperateley to the pc itself but not through getting the code on github)

please email me for suggestions at Goofyman2223@gmail.com
